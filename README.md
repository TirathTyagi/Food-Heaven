# Food-Heaven
This application was developed for my final project for Android App Development Course. This application lists all the fictional restaurants that were extracted through the web from an API consisting of JSON file with information. This API was provided in the course only. This application uses ROOM library for databases, Picasso library for Image Display and Volley Library for data extraction from the web. I will be developing this application in the future for real world usage with all real world restaurants around the user with their stats like meny, rate, images etc.
